# Wordle

In this project, I made Wordle game clone using flutter in Turkish Language.


Here is how a wordle of four letters looks like:

Another possible wordle is five-letter wordle:

When a user loses the game, the app will show the wordle of the day and a timer for next wordle:

The same applies when he wins:

User's inputs are persistant. Therefore, if a user reopened the app, he can continue from where he stopped:

User's input is being checked against a dectionary to validity the word:

Lastly, as the wordles are comming from Firebase Google services, the app checks for a vaild internet connection:
